MCU (short for Magnetic stripe Card Utility) is a software for reading
and decoding signals from an ultra-simple magnetic stripe card reader
described in the 2600 magazine Volume 22, issue #1,in the article called
"Magnetic Stripe Reading" on the page 28. This article is also republished
at http://sephail.net/articles/magstripe/ .

Technically, the application binds the RTAudio library, needed for
platform-independent audio I/O, with the routines from dab.c/dmsb.c
files from the aforementioned article. The software is written in C++,
as it is needed by RtAudio.
