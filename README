                     ----------------------------

MCU (short for Magnetic stripe Card Utility) is a software for reading
and decoding signals from an ultra-simple magnetic stripe card reader
described in the 2600 magazine Volume 22, issue #1,in the article called
"Magnetic Stripe Reading" on the page 28. This article is also republished
at http://sephail.net/articles/magstripe/ .

Technically, the application binds the RTAudio library (https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio),
needed for platform-independent audio I/O, with the routines from dab.c/dmsb.c
files from the aforementioned article. The software is written in C++,
as it is needed by RtAudio.

Compiling
---------

Currently the program is trimmed to compile on Win* platform. Linux users
may either work with the original dab.c/dmsb.c sources or make MCU compile
under Linux (or any other UNIX) too.

Prerequisites:

0. MinGW compiler (for example: https://nuwen.net/mingw.html)

Steps:

1. Get RtAudio-4.1.0 library from https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio/releases/tag/4.1.0
   and unpack it into the directory with MCU sources

2. Type

      make

And voila, you have the executable. Run it with

      ./mcu -h

to get acquainted with possible options.


TODO
----

* Integrate libsndfile for decoding files recorded previously

* Implement other bitstream decoders
